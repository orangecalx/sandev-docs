It features a square of 50grit sandpaper adhered to the front panel for greater sonic exploration, an input for external contact mics and other audio sources, and infrared LED based active distortion. SPECIFICATIONS 20HP wide Skiff-friendly 50ma~ at +12v, 50ma~ at -12 1kOhm input / 100kOhm output impedence Vactrol control with CV in CONTROLS (identical for each channel) PIEZO GAIN Gain of the preamplifier for each piezo disk. Able to distort at highest settings. DIODE AMT. Amount of diode distortion applied to the preamp output. Very disgusting sounding. OUT 1/2 Main output. EXT. INPUT Input for external signals - designed for contact mics but will accept any audio signal. Interrupts the main piezo signal with a cable plugged in. TIPS / TRICKS As demonstrated, don't be afraid to abuse the module. The two contact mics are located to the left and right of the panel's center - this allows for some very weird \"\"stereo\"\" effects. The module can be used as a distortion effect by patching essentially whatever you want into the \"ext input\" jack. Note that this is intended for audio only.
